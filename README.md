## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned to use media queries to help format the website for both mobile and desktop layouts. Refresh on javascript to learn how to make animated transitions whenever a question is clicked on.

### Continued development

Need to still figure out how to hide all the questions that are currently not selected. A good lesson to practice jquery with.
